-- Optimize RLS policies for performance by fixing auth.uid() calls
-- This migration wraps auth.uid() in SELECT to prevent re-evaluation for each row
-- See: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#call-functions-with-select

-- The fix: auth.uid() â†’ (select auth.uid())
-- This ensures the function is evaluated once per query instead of once per row

-- This is a large migration that will recreate many policies
-- We'll do this table by table
